* [Executing The Test](#executing-the-test)
* [Local Testing With TestNG](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Selenium automation testing on LambdaTest, you need to:

* Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on LambdaTest‚Äôs Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

Clone the LambdaTest‚Äôs [jest-selenium-webdriver-sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/jest-selenium-webdriver-sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/jest-selenium-webdriver-sample
cd jest-selenium-webdriver-sample
```
Next, you need to install **Jest**. Run the below command to install Jest:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest --force
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
$env:LT_USERNAME='YOUR USERNAME'
$env:LT_ACCESS_KEY='YOUR ACCESS KEY'
  ```

## Run Your First Test

### Sample Test with Jest
**Test Scenario:** Let‚Äôs check a sample **Jest** Selenium code running on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. This is a simple Jest test automation script that tests a sample to-do list app. Check out this [single.test.js](https://github.com/LambdaTest/jest-selenium-webdriver-sample/blob/master/test/single.test.js) file to run your first sample test.

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```js
 const capabilities = {
  build: 'jest-LambdaTest-Single',
  browserName: 'chrome',
  version: 'latest',
  platform: 'Windows 10',
};
```
> You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample)**.

## Executing the Test

The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command
```bash
npm test single.test.js
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here‚Äôs how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user‚Äôs login email} -key {user‚Äôs access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
### Executing Local Tests with Jest

To run parallel tests using **Jest**, we would have to execute the below command in the terminal:
```bash
npm test local.test.js
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=jest-selenium-webdriver-sample).
